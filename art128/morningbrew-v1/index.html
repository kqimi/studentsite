            <p>
                The story of Morning Brew, or at least its conception, started back in 1991 in Manhattan Beach,
                California. While Debbie was working her way through an interior design program at UCLA she
                had picked up a part-time job at a popular café in Manhattan Beach called “Tout- Suite.” While
                working there she got her first taste of the “café lifestyle” and soon became enamored. Peter
                would come in for breakfast on his days off and would end up hanging out to help Debbie clean
                up at the end of her shift. It wasn’t long before the two were discussing the possibilities of opening
                their own café, back home in Honolulu, Hawaii, where both of them grew up. Debbie and Peter
                were high school sweethearts at Punahou School, where they both graduated in 1983.Nearly
                two years later, once Debbie had completed her design program, the two returned to Hawaii to
p               pursue their dream of opening their own café.
